    "The pursuit of a college education has consistently been tied to graduates' financial success compared to non-graduates; on average, graduates are 1/2 as likely to be unemployed and have 84% higher income than those whose highest education is a high school diploma. Every year, high school graduates have to decide if the cost of college -- both tuition _and_ being out of the workforce for 4 years -- is worth the financial benefit. On top of the decision to attend, they must choose a major, a decision that could determine the degree of their financial success and the magnitude of benefits reaped from attending college."

    "A typical reason why a certain major's salary would be important to a college graduate is that many come to college for upward mobility. College is seen by many as a pathway to a higher financial and social standing as well as a higher quality of life. This extends further than simply their post-graduation salary, but the mean income of the location in which they live, as quality of life is largely affected by the wealth of those around you, as it impacts the opportunities available, public school funding, health, and much more. Perhaps the mean income of postgraduates' region of residence indicates the degree of their major's impact on their financial success and quality of life."

We will train a multivariable regression on data tables from both Wikepedia and the U.S. Census Bureau to see if we can reliably predict a county's per capita income given the population percentages of Science and Engineering, Business, Education, and Arts, Humanities, and Others for each of these age groups: 25-39 years, 40-64 years, and 65 years and over. Essentially, we aim to determine if college major and age affects the average wealth of where people live.\n",

The rest of the columns are each group / category of college major. The values in those columns are the percentage of the specific major in a specific county.\n",

We also had to convert many string columns into floats and ints, as the % signs and the commas in the data we extracted from the Census and Wikepedia both had numerical values in the form of a string. We also had to change the names of many columns because they had unnecessarily long and verbose names, including the County names. With our cleaned data, we divided that one big dataframe into three dataframes, each one representing one age group. We merged the Wikepedia data and the big cleaned Census data we had into one. We then merged the Wikepedia dataframe with each of the three smaller dataframes for each age group. We split it into age-specific dataframes because we wanted to view the data in both an age-specific context and an age-blind context.\n",
