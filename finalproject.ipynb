    "The pursuit of a college education has consistently been tied to graduates' financial success compared to non-graduates; on average, graduates are 1/2 as likely to be unemployed and have 84% higher income than those whose highest education is a high school diploma. Every year, high school graduates have to decide if the cost of college -- both tuition _and_ being out of the workforce for 4 years -- is worth the financial benefit. On top of the decision to attend, they must choose a major, a decision that could determine the degree of their financial success and the magnitude of benefits reaped from attending college."

    "A typical reason why a certain major's salary would be important to a college graduate is that many come to college for upward mobility. College is seen by many as a pathway to a higher financial and social standing as well as a higher quality of life. This extends further than simply their post-graduation salary, but the mean income of the location in which they live, as quality of life is largely affected by the wealth of those around you, as it impacts the opportunities available, public school funding, health, and much more. Perhaps the mean income of postgraduates' region of residence indicates the degree of their major's impact on their financial success and quality of life."

    "Thus, we are interested in exploring the relationship between the college major of a college postgraduate and the wealth of their county of residence. We decided we were most interested in exploring this relationship within New York State, where there is a _dramatic_ wealth gap between its most affluent regions (for example, New York City) versus its most poor regions; in fact, New York was recognized as the state with the highest gap between the rich and the poor, with a Gini coefficient score in 2022 of 0.52."

    "At the conclusion of this project, we seek to determine if there is a correlation between college major and the per capita income of the postgraduate county of residence in New York, and age and the per capita income of the postgraduate county of residence in New York. We will train a multivariable regression on data tables from both Wikepedia and the U.S. Census Bureau to see if we can reliably predict a county's per capita income given the population percentages of Science and Engineering, Business, Education, and Arts, Humanities, and Others for each of these age groups: 25-39 years, 40-64 years, and 65 years and over. Essentially, we aim to determine if college major and age affects the average wealth of where people live.\n",

    "Below, we are replacing the !!s and the spaces with an underscore, then selecting the relevant columns which have each county's total percentage (not including the columns regarding margin or error, total estimate, NYS as a whole, or Male/Female specific columns). There were a lot of columns to be dropped (more than half), so after trying to use .drop(), a TA helped us realize we should just extract the columns of interest and put it into a new dataframe, which we called census_majors_cleaned. We then rename the suffix of each column, _New_York_Percent_Estimate, to County so that we have [name] County as each column's name, so the column names are consistent with the County column of the Wikepedia dataframe."

An interesting outlier is Warren County, which has a much higher percentage of Education majors relative to similarly-wealthy counties. Upon inspection, the county is located very close to Albany, the capital of the state and has a sizeable population, so it may be that many educators of the metropolis live in the county. However, this claim is purely speculative and requires further investigation to validate a cause for the county's higher percentage of Education majors."

We also had to change the names of many columns because they had unnecessarily long and verbose names, including the County names. With our cleaned data, we divided that one big dataframe into three dataframes, each one representing one age group. We merged the Wikepedia data and the big cleaned Census data we had into one. We then merged the Wikepedia dataframe with each of the three smaller dataframes for each age group.

    "- Another limitation is that the Census lumps together a broad variety of majors into \"STEM\", \"Humanities\", etc. which may result in a lack of consideration of certain outliers within those major-groups. For example, Psychology may be considered STEM, but it may not follow the same trends as a Computer Science major.\n",
    "- Another limitation is that the Wikepedia data is outdated by 13 years, as its most recent data is from 2010. This may be an issue because our Census data is much more recent."

    "In the previous model, we discovered from the OLS regression that there is a relatively small relationship between Science and Engineering percentage within a county's graduates on the county's per capita income. Additionally, the p-value for this coefficient is greater than 0.05, indicating that it is likely that the null hypothesis is supported. Thus, we accept the null hypothesis and conclude that it is likely that there is little to no relationship from science and engineering percentage of graduates within a county on that county's income."
